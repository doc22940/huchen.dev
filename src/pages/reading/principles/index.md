* To have a child was the most difficult decision I ever made, because I couldn’t know what the experience would be like and it would be irrevocable. It turned out to be my best decision.

* Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2.Know when not to have an opinion. 3.Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4.Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.

* beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weaknesses.

* Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.

* Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.

* Idealists who are not well grounded in reality create problems, not progress.

* It can be any kind of long-term challenge that leads to personal improvement.

  * I think this should be the definition of a good job

* If you choose to push through this often painful process of personal evolution, you will naturally “ascend” to higher and higher levels.

* The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.

* Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life—you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.

* Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak.

* No matter what you want out of life, your ability to adapt and move quickly and efficiently through the process of personal evolution will determine your success and your happiness.

* 1.Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. 2.Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals. 3.Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones. 4.Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress. 5.Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

* You will need to do all five steps well to be successful and you must do them one at a time and in order.

* make sure you are investing them in exploring the problems that, if fixed, will yield you the biggest returns.

* Practice higher-level thinking by looking down on your machine and thinking about how it can be changed to produce better outcomes.

* Sketch out the plan broadly at first (e.g., “hire great people”) and then refine it. You should go from the big picture and drill down to specific tasks and estimated time lines

  * This is exactly what OKR is

* Identifying and not tolerating problems requires you to be perceptive and good at synthesis and maintaining high standards; diagnosis requires you to be logical, able to see multiple possibilities, and willing to have hard conversations with others; designing requires visualization and practicality; doing what you set out to do requires self-discipline, good work habits, and a results orientation.

* There are two paths to success: 1) to have what you need yourself or 2) to get it from others. The second path requires you to have humility. Humility is as important, or even more important, as having the strengths yourself.

* The two biggest barriers to good decision making are your ego and your blind spots.

* Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with “not knowing” is more important than whatever it is you do know.

* Remember that you’re looking for the best answer, not simply the best answer that you can come up with yourself.

* I’ll simply recommend the Dalai Lama’s book, Beyond Religion, if you’re interested in learning more.

* Then I read Charles Duhigg’s best-selling book The Power of Habit, which really opened my eyes.

* The most valuable habit I’ve acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections.

* decision making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding).

* It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one’s limits, which is painful

* Realize that you can’t put out without taking in.

* Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are how people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences

* A believability-weighted idea meritocracy is the best system for making effective decisions.

* Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making.

* Make your passion and your work one and the same and do it with people you want to be with.

* Work is either 1) a job you do to earn the money to pay for the life you want to have or 2) what you do to achieve your mission, or some mix of the two. I urge you to make it as much 2) as possible, recognizing the value of 1). If you do that, most everything will go better than if you don’t.

* To have an Idea Meritocracy: 1) Put your honest thoughts on the table 2) Have thoughtful disagreement 3) Abide by agreed-upon ways of getting past disagreement

* Just like everything else, principles need to be questioned and debated. What you’re not allowed to do is complain and criticize privately—either to others or in your own head.
