    Hi there, thanks for visiting my site. My name is Hu Chen and I was born in China, currently living in Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest is to build <%= link_to "digital products", "/work.html" %> that people love and care about. I am a product guy who does both design and code, I believe best products comes from people with experiences of both front and back.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love to make simple and aesthetic user experience, ideally my mom should be able to use the app without any instructions. I was awarded by <a href="http://www.cssdesignawards.com/sites/new-zealand-in-23-days/24343/">CSS Design Awards</a> and <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/best-websites/new-zealand-in-23-days">Awwwards</a> in the past, looking forward to have more. I love web design, frontend development and always on track of latest trends, get inspirations from other peopleâ€™s awesome work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love to talk with passionate people with all sorts of crazy ideas, if you are, please <%= link_to "chat with me", "/contact.html" %>. I am also a world explorer, hiker and I enjoy the moments with my loved ones.
